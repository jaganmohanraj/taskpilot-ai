# TaskPilot AI

**Transform AI assistants from helpful chatbots into disciplined execution systems.**

TaskPilot AI is a commercial-grade MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that brings **persistent memory**, **anti-drift controls**, **verifier-gated completion**, and **intelligent project management** to AI-assisted work.

## The Problem

Most AI assistants:
- Forget context between sessions
- Drift away from original goals
- Falsely claim tasks are complete
- Lack systematic project tracking
- Have no verification gates
- Can't prove what actually got done

## The Solution

TaskPilot AI provides:

✅ **Verifier-Gated Completion** - Projects cannot be marked done until all criteria pass
✅ **External Verification** - Run actual tests, builds, lints to prove completion
✅ **Real-Time Updates** - WebSocket-powered live dashboard with instant notifications
✅ **Composite Operations** - Batch tasks, bulk updates, project cloning, templates
✅ **Anti-Drift Detection** - Continuous monitoring prevents scope creep and goal misalignment
✅ **Persistent Memory** - Full audit trail of decisions, blockers, assumptions, and evidence
✅ **State Machine** - Enforced project lifecycle from draft → verified → done
✅ **Health Scoring** - Real-time project health and completeness metrics
✅ **Intelligent Work Breakdown** - Context-aware task generation from acceptance criteria
✅ **Dependency Management** - Task dependencies with automatic next-action suggestions
✅ **Audit History** - Complete timeline of all project state changes

## Key Differentiators

### 1. No Fake Completion ⛔
Projects cannot close until:
- All tasks are done
- All blockers are resolved
- Evidence is logged **and validated for quality**
- Acceptance criteria are met
- Drift checks pass
- **External verification passes** (tests, builds, lints)

**Enforcement**: Direct attempts to mark projects "done" are blocked at the architecture level. The verifier must pass with 100/100 score, including optional external verification.

### 2. External Verification 🔬
Prove completion with actual execution:
- **Test Execution**: Run npm test, pytest, etc.
- **Build Verification**: Ensure code compiles
- **Lint Checks**: Code quality validation
- **Git Verification**: Commits and clean working tree
- **Custom Checks**: Configurable commands
- **Automatic Evidence**: Results logged as proof

### 3. Real-Time Collaboration 🔄
- **WebSocket Updates**: Live project/task changes
- **Live Notifications**: Toast alerts for events
- **Auto-Refresh**: Dashboard updates without reload
- **Multi-User Ready**: Subscribe to project channels
- **Event Streaming**: All changes broadcast instantly

### 4. Composite Operations ⚡
Efficient batch and bulk operations:
- **Batch Task Creation**: Create multiple tasks at once
- **Bulk Status Updates**: Update many tasks together
- **Project Cloning**: Duplicate entire projects
- **Project Templates**: Reusable project patterns
- **Bulk Archiving**: Archive completed projects
- **Aggregated Stats**: Cross-project insights

### 5. Anti-Drift System
Automatic detection of:
- Scope drift (too many tasks)
- Goal mismatch (vague objectives)
- Incomplete criteria
- Abandoned tasks
- Unresolved blockers

### 6. Full Memory Persistence 💾
Every project stores:
- **Decisions** - What was decided and why
- **Assumptions** - What we're assuming (and whether verified)
- **Blockers** - What's preventing progress
- **Evidence** - Proof of completion (quality-scored 0-100)
- **State History** - Complete timeline with reasons

**Evidence Validation**: All evidence is scored for quality. Suspicious patterns like "done" or "ok" trigger warnings.

### 7. Execution Intelligence 🧠
- Smart work breakdown from acceptance criteria
- Priority and dependency awareness
- Next-best-action recommendations
- Health and completeness scoring
- Automatic state transition enforcement
- Test coverage: 70-80% across core modules

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaganmohanraj/taskpilot-ai.git
cd taskpilot-ai
npm install
npm run build
```

### Run the MCP Server

```bash
npm run start:mcp
```

Launch the interactive web dashboard for visual project management:

```bash
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

The dashboard provides:
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket-powered live updates without refresh

- **Create Projects**: Interactive forms to create new projects
- **Live Notifications**: Toast notifications for verification results and updates
- **Batch Operations**: Create multiple tasks, clone projects, bulk updates
- **External Verification**: Run tests/builds directly from UI

### Use with Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "taskpilot-ai": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/taskpilot-ai/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Core Workflow

### 1. Create a Project

Use the `start_project` prompt with your request.

TaskPilot will:
- Extract a clear title and objective
- Define testable acceptance criteria
- Generate an intelligent work breakdown
- Track everything in SQLite

### 2. Execute With Discipline

As you work:
- Update task status
- Log decisions and assumptions
- Record blockers
- Save evidence
- The system auto-updates health scores

### 3. Verify Before Closure

Use the `closeout_review` prompt.

TaskPilot will:
- Run completion audit
- Detect drift
- List gaps
- Only close if verified
